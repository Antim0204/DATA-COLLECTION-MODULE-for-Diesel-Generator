# DATA-COLLECTION-MODULE-for-Diesel-Generator-

## Project Overview
In the era of Industry 4.0, digital twin technology has emerged as a transformative approach for optimizing industrial processes and equipment. This project focuses on the first phase: the Data Collection Module (DCM) of a digital twin for a Diesel Generator. The goal is to enhance monitoring, control, and maintenance by leveraging real-time data.

## Highlights
- **Data Collection**: Real-time data from various parameters of a Diesel Generator.
- **Sensors**: Utilized multiple sensors for accurate data acquisition.
- **Cloud Storage**: Stored data on ThingSpeak cloud services.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Visualized data using ThingSpeak widgets and MATLAB.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Created correlation plots using MATLAB to analyze relationships between different parameters.

## Sensors Used
- **OF05ZAT G1/2 DN15 Oil Flow Sensor**: Measures diesel flow rate.
- **MAX6675 Thermocouple Sensor Module and K-type Thermocouple**: Measures temperature of the radiator, engine, and environment.
- **MPU-6050 3-Axis Accelerometer**: Measures body vibration of the diesel generator.

## ThingSpeak Cloud Services
### Data Storage
- Utilized ThingSpeak channels to store data collected from sensors.
### Data Visualization
- Leveraged ThingSpeak widgets for interactive and real-time data visualization.

## Data Visualization with ThingSpeak Widgets
- **Gauges & Meters**: Used for temperature, vibration, and fuel level monitoring.
- **Real-time Plots**: Plotted data against time for analysis of different parameters.

## Correlation Plots Using MATLAB
- Created correlation plots using MATLAB code to analyze relationships between various parameters, providing deeper insights into generator performance.
